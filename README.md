Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### Smart Networking City 

OVERVIEW:  
Key areas include traffic management, resource allocation, and public safety, requiring shortest-path algorithms, 
scheduling techniques, and real-time data analysis. The project emphasizes designing algorithms with minimal time 
and space complexity to handle large-scale data efficiently. Applications may involve optimizing smart transportation, 
energy grids, and waste collection. By leveraging algorithmic principles, the project aims to create sustainable,
connected, and intelligent urban environments, addressing challenges like scalability, cost-efficiency, and responsiveness.

Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  

By addressing challenges like scalability and real-time data processing, these algorithms improve transportation,
energy grids, and waste management systems, enhancing overall city functionality. The project has a significant impact
on improving quality of life through smarter infrastructure, reducing congestion, and enabling responsive governance.
Additionally, it promotes environmental sustainability by minimizing energy waste and lowering carbon emissions. 
Economic growth is fostered through tech-driven innovation and job creation, while the city becomes more adaptable
to emergencies. This project highlights the transformative role of algorithmic solutions in creating sustainable and
intelligent urban environments.
