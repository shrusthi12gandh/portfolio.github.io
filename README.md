### Hello, I'm Shrusthi gandh 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### Smart Networking System 

OVERVIEW:  
It leverages adaptive algorithms to intelligently route traffic, enhance bandwidth utilization,
and minimize latency. The system utilizes machine learning techniques for real-time decision-making,
enabling dynamic adjustment to network conditions. It also integrates security protocols to ensure 
data integrity and privacy. By utilizing predictive analytics, the system can proactively adjust to
demand fluctuations, improving overall network performance and reliability. Additionally, it supports
seamless scaling to accommodate growing network nodes and devices

Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  
By optimizing data routing and dynamically adjusting to network conditions, it enhances overall network efficiency,
reducing latency and improving user experience. The system’s real-time adaptability allows it to handle traffic 
fluctuations seamlessly, ensuring reliable performance even during peak usage. Security improvements also ensure
safer data transmission, mitigating risks associated with cyber threats. Furthermore, its ability to predict network 
demands and scale accordingly makes it highly resilient, capable of supporting the increasing complexity and size 
of modern networks. This leads to cost savings, more efficient resource usage, and better support for emerging 
technologies such as IoT, 5G, and AI-driven applications.
